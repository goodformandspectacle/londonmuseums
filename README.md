londonmuseums
=============

I've been tending and altering the list of museums which Wikipedia knows about. Just casually over the last few months. You can see the source data file here: https://github.com/goodformandspectacle/londonmuseums/blob/master/glo-museums-split-dates.csv

Main data I've added is about when the museum was founded or opened. I've also gathered accurate addresses where I can find them. Thanks as well to @infovore for helping translate the postcodes into lat/lon for me.

I'd like to try to make a couple of things with this.

* A poster of the building outlines from OSM, perhaps ordered by age of institution, or some other interesting facet.
* A navigable map/website which I can populate with more data as I, and hopefully other people, visit the museums in London. Opening hours, admission fees, keywords, gfs:visit=*, photo URLs, object counts, etc etc 

I published a basic cartoDB visualization on November 8, 2014 and blogged about it here:

If you'd like to help me make a poster or something else printed with London museum map data, please get in touch!
