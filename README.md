londonmuseums
=============

I've been tending and altering the list of museums which Wikipedia knows about. Just casually over the last few months. Here's the spreadsheet (which is set to 'Anyone with the link can edit'):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Amodx1bSXsMTdFdFUE5VdVF0QnBiZkVIOERlaFVVNnc&usp=sharing

Main data I've added is about when the museum was founded or opened. I've also gathered accurate addresses where I can find them, but I'm still working down the list.

I'd like to see if we can make a couple of things with this.

1) A poster of the building outlines from OSM, perhaps ordered by age of institution, or some other interesting facet.
2) A navigable map/website which I can populate with more data as I, and hopefully other people, visit the museums in London. Opening hours, admission fees, keywords, gfs:visit=*, photo URLs, object counts, etc etc
